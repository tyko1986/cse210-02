# Cycle
Cycle is a game of two snakes, where each one of the snakes tries to make its opponent to crash with its tail, be careful because each snake grows as the time passes.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.

```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
