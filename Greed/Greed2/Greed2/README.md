# Greed
Mattew 13:45-46 says: "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. Are you willing to loose all you have to get the pearl of great price?
Greed is a game where you have to get all great price gems you can, but be carefull because there are rocks on you way that will hold you back from your goal
