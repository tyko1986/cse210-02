# Hilo
Are you willing to risk everything? Play Hilo and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. Hilo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher or lower than the previous one. Points are won or lost based on whether or not the player guessed correctly.
The game starts with a total of 300 score points. If the player guess right, the player gets 100 points but if doesn't, the player will loose 75 points.
